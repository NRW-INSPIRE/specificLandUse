+ Land so damaged by previous industrial or other development that it is incapable of beneficial use without treatment, where treatment includes any of the following: demolition, clearing of fixed structures or foundations and levelling.

+ Abandoned and unoccupied buildings in an advanced state of disrepair i.e. with unsound roof(s).

– Excludes land damaged by development which has been or is being restored for agriculture, forestry, woodland or other open countryside use.

– Excludes land damaged by a previous development where the remains of any structure or activity have blended into the landscape in the process of time (to the extent that it can reasonably be considered as part of the natural surroundings), and where there is a clear reason that could outweigh the re-use of the site - such as its contribution to nature conservation - or it has subsequently been put to an amenity use and cannot be regarded as requiring redevelopment.
