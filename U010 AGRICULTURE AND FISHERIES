Agriculture includes horticulture, fruit growing, seed growing, dairy farming, the breeding and keeping of livestock (including any creature kept for the production of food, wool, skins or fur), the use of land as grazing land, meadow land, osier land, market gardens and nursery grounds, and the use of woodlands where that use is ancillary to the farming of land for other agricultural purposes.
